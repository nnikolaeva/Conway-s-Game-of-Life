## Conway's Game of Life project

Conwayâ€™s game of life implementation on using in-house game engine, supports drag-and-drop to build game board using predefined patterns

####HOW TO RUN THE APPLICATION

1. Download all files and open index.html in your favorite browser.
2. Or view the application at http://nnikolaeva.github.io/conway-s-game-of-life

####RULES
The universe of the Game of Life is grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by over-population.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

####HOW TO USE APPLICATION
1. Use the mouse to click on play, pause, stop, randomize buttons
2. Use the mouse to drag and drop predefined patterns
