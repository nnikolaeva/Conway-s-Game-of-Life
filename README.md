## Conway's Game of Life

This is my implementation of Conwayâ€™s game of life using in-house developed game engine. It allows to build board configuration by dragging and dropping predefined patterns.

#### How to run 

Open application at http://nnikolaeva.github.io/conway-s-game-of-life.

#### How to use
You can use play and pause buttons to start and pause the game. The square button clears the board and stops the game. The dice button fills the board randomly. Drag and drop patterns from the left panel onto the board to add them to the game.
